# 👋 Hi, I'm Constantin

🎓 **AI & Applied Mathematics PhD Candidate at ENS–PSL**  
🧠 Researching cognitive modeling, machine learning, and decision-making systems  
💼 AI Advisor & **Board Member** in technology and media companies  

---

## 🔍 Research Focus

I study how humans (and agents) make adaptive decisions under uncertainty.  
My work blends:

- Applied mathematics (PDEs, stochastic modeling)
- Machine learning & deep learning
- Cognitive science & behavioral modeling
- Multi-agent systems (LLMs and coordination)

I aim to develop **interpretable**, **mathematically grounded**, and **generalizable** models of executive function and exploration–exploitation dynamics.

---

## 💻 Technical Interests

- Training dynamics of LLM multi-agent systems
- Scientific computing & optimization
- Representation learning
- Probabilistic modeling
- Decision-making under uncertainty

I enjoy **reverse-engineering** intelligent behavior and using math to solve real-world problems.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Python** (numpy, scipy, pandas, PyTorch, scikit-learn)  
**OCaml**, **C**, **Java**, **SQL**, **JavaScript**  
Scientific tooling: **PsychoPy/PsychoJS**, **nilearn**, **LaTeX**  
Systems: **Linux**, Arch, NixOS, networking, robotics  

---

## 🎶 Artistic Work

I compose film and media music (classical, jazz, contemporary) and perform:

- Piano, violin, trumpet (ENS Brass Band)
- Lyric baritone

### 💃 Movement, Coordination & Interaction

Teacher and choreographer in:
- East-coast swing
- Waltz

I also dance Tango, Salsa, Polka, 4-steps rock and West-coast swing.

Dance informs my interest in **coordination**, **communication**, and **feedback loops** between agents.

### 🐎 Equestrian Background

Level **Galop 5**, interested in the embodied intelligence of the horse-rider system:  
balance, anticipation, and subtle communication — concepts that echo in my research.

### ✍️ Creative Writing

Founder of the ENS Writing Club.  
Clear, concise communication is essential when conveying complex ideas.

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I’m always happy to discuss:

- Machine learning research
- Cognitive/neuroscientific modeling
- AI strategy & responsible deployment
- Music Projects, including film scoring and audiovisual projects
